# BB-SKY-API-Google-Sheets

This is just my implementation of Google Sheets + Google Apps Script to pull advanced lists using SKY API.  This is just one way of doing it, and definitely not the best way.  I'm simply providing my code and steps I took, in case it helps others who need help setting up a system like this.
